## Setting up a Raspberry PI 3
This tutorial is optional and will outline the installation required steps including:

[1. copying an Ubuntu Mate image to an SD card](#copying-the-ubuntu-mate-image)
[2. installing Ubuntu Mate]()
[3. enabling SSH]()
[4. identifying IP address]()
[5. installing Mosquitto MQTT (clients, publishers and broker)]()
[6. setting up a LoRa Gateway (with LoRa expansion board)]()
[7. setting up a Flask API]()

## Copying the Ubuntu Mate image

Ubuntu Mate can be downloaded here: https://ubuntu-mate.org/raspberry-pi/ This link also includes guidance on how to extract and copy the image to an SD card using for instance Win32 Disk Imager if you are using a Windows OS.

The steps below outline how to do so under MAC OSX (http://terraltech.com/copying-an-image-to-the-sd-card-in-mac-os-x/):

```
### Install .xz unarchiver
`brew install xz`

### unarchive
`xz -d ubuntu-mate-16.04.2-desktop-armhf-raspberry-pi.img.xz`

### displays disk usage information based on file system (ie: entire drives, attached media, etc)
First without connecting the SD card to USB, list devices
`df -h`

Connect your SD card and noticed the added device in the list
`df -h`

For instance: "/dev/disk1s1"

### Unmount the partition so that you will be allowed to overwrite the disk
`sudo diskutil unmount /dev/disk1s1`

### Writing image on the raw device
If the mounted identifier is "disk1s1", we will write to the raw device identifier "rdisk1"

Using the device name of the partition work out the raw device name for the entire disk, by omitting the final “s1” and replacing “disk” with “rdisk”.
Exemple: /dev/disk1s1 -> /dev/rdisk1

`sudo dd bs=1m if=ubuntu-mate-16.04.2-desktop-armhf-raspberry-pi.img of=/dev/rdisk1`

After the dd command finishes, eject the card

### Eject the card
sudo diskutil eject /dev/rdisk1

```
