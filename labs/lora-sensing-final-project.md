# LoRa sensing | Final project

## Introduction
In this lab. we will consider the following setup:

![](https://i.imgur.com/OIY6tBP.png)

where:
* LoPys on Pysense boards will make measurements and send it over LoRa;
* then a Raspberry Pi and its LoRa expansion board once received, will serve them through an API;
* last, client machine(s) will fetch measurements via the API and anlyze it (using Jupyter Notebooks).

To be clear, again, communication between IoT nodes (Lopys + Pysense expansion boards) and the Raspberry PI (used as a LoRa gateway) will be ensured via LoRa. As regards, communication between the client machines and the Raspberry PI, it will be ensured via WiFi in a LAN. 

An example use case might be a farm where you deploy dozens of sensors to monitor temperature, humidity, soil moisture, CO2, ... in agricultural fields, aggregate the measurements in a Gateway and then analyze, monitor, decide using analytical platforms (here Jupyter Notebooks and Python).

## Learning outcomes
This lab. will allow to recap most of the components seen so far in a realistic use case. Once the base/reference architecture implemented, you will be asked to further improve it for instance by adding a simple notification system or any ideas you might consider relevant and use your creativity.

## LoRa node setup
We will start with the LoRa node setup. This is pretty straighforward as this is something we have seen already. We will just access Pycom's Pysense Python lib to get measurements and send it as LoRa packets.

You will find the source code in the following folder: [`src/lora-sensing-final-project`](https://github.com/franckalbinet/iot-uaa-isoc/tree/master/labs/src/lora-sensing-final-project)

## Setting up the Raspberry LoRa Gateway

To run the LoRa Gateway, in  `/raspi-lora-gateway` folder run the following command: `sudo ./gateway`

Below the code of `main.py` file:

```python
import network
from network import LoRa
import binascii
import socket
import machine
import time
import binascii
import sys
import utils # utilities module with CRC calculation

# Initialize LoRa in LORA mode.
lora = LoRa(mode=LoRa.LORA)

# Get loramac as id to be sent in message
lora_mac = binascii.hexlify(network.LoRa().mac()).decode('utf8')

# Create a raw LoRa socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_LORA, socket.SOCK_RAW)

count_tx = 0

# tx loop
while True:
    s.setblocking(True)

    msgtx = str(count_tx) + ',' + lora_mac
    crc8 = utils.crc(msgtx.encode('utf8'))
    msgtx = msgtx + ',' + crc8

    s.send(msgtx)
    print('Tx: {} is sending data ...'.format(lora_mac))

    count_tx += 1

    # Get any data received...
    s.setblocking(False)
    data = s.recv(64)

    time.sleep(2)
```



## Setting up the Flask API
```
pip install flask
sudo apt-get install python-pandas
```
In a terminal/console, run `export FLASK_APP=api.py`

in folder `/flask-api`, run `flask run --host=0.0.0.0`

Get the Raspberry Pi IP address: `hostname -I` for instance 192.168.1.101

Open your browser, you should be able to get data dumped by the LoRa Gateway by writing this URL `http://192.168.1.101:5000/gateway/api`
